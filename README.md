# IJC437 - Predicting Song Popularity using Audio Features from Spotify Data
This repository contains the necessary files related to IJC437 coursework.

This project explores how different audio features influences song popularity offering valuable insights to the music industry.

This project uses the MusicOset dataset. 
It includes data files such as Artists, Songs, Song Chart, Releases, Tracks, Acoustic Features etc.

# Steps to run code for data pre-processing (Optional)
This GitHub repository contains a Folder named Data Cleaning.

1.Open the folder (It contains a R file named IJC437 Data Cleaning.R. This file contains the R code used for cleaning the dataset. However, this section is not evaluated as part of the assessment. This code has been submitted for reference on how the data cleaning is performed and to provide the full picture of the work performed as part of this project.
However, if you would like to run the code, you would have noticed that there are 6 csv files in the Data Cleaning Folder in this GitHub Repository. These are the files from the dataset that we will use for this project.)

2.To run the code, download the 6 csv files and the R file.

The end result from running this file is you obtain a merged dataset.

NOTE- THE ABOVE INSTRUCTION ARE PROVIDED TO RUN AN OPTIONAL CODE FILE USED TO PRE-PROCESS THE DATA.
RUNNING THIS CODE CAN BE SKIPPED.
